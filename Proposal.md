We are interested in studying two algorithms. First, due to the fact that we both are members of the menâ€™s club volleyball team, and are a part of the Eastern Collegiate Volleyball Association, or ECVA, we are interested in finding the most optimal hosting locations for tournaments. With two league tournaments, and colleges scattered throughout the region, we want to use an algorithm to find the most, and second most optimal locations for the host schools of these tournaments, based on the least total distance traveled by the visiting teams. We already have most of the needed data in a readily accessible format so it should be easy to get started. For the METAL data we will be looking into the shortest path, particularly the A* algorithm. We can look into the shortest path by cumulative distance with a weight factor for the amount of travelers for each road. This weight factor can have a positive or negative correlation with the amount of travelers that use the road.
