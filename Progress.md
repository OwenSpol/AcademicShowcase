# Progress Update 1
We worked on designing our algorithm for finding the most and second most optimal volleyball hosting locations. The algorithm may need to be updated as right now it is based on the latitudes and longitudes of each school's location which doesn't factor in the actual distance that will be traveled on roads and is a direct distance calculation from point A to point B. Additionally, the initial algorithm is very brute force running with O(n^3) time and we are hoping we can make it more efficient. Moving forward to the next progress update, we plan to clean our data so it can be more easily used and improve our algortihm, and we plan to start working with the Metal data as well.
# Progress Update 2
We ensured our data was correct and clean. It is now in csv format. Additional we continued our design of an algorithm that can find the best hosting location, we used the METAL method to calculate distance. We have decided to go directly from Point A to Point B, this is because if we wanted waypoints for the routes, it would involve doing a breath first search in METAL, and using a O(m * n * n) algorithm. Moving forward to next progress update, we plan to start sorting our data into the different tournaments.
# Progress Update 3
We created a new Teams class within the ECVA class in order to store the information about each team together as a Teams object. We then atted a sortTeams algorithm to sort the list of team by their region and division (ex. all central region division 1 teams first then all central region division 2 teams and so on). Moving forward to the next progress update, we plan to begin working more with the METAL data, and begin using our sorted teams data to find the optimal hosting locations.
